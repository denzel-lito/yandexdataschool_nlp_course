    "Not all wrong answers are equally wrong. As the training progresses, _most negative examples $a^-$ will be to easy._ So easy in fact, that loss function and gradients on such negatives is exactly __0.0__. To improve training efficiency, one can __mine hard negative samples__.\n",

    "\n",
    "* You can ask such model a question of your own making - to see which answers it can find among the entire training dataset or even the entire wikipedia.\n",

    "* This task is much easier to train if you use hard or semi-hard negatives. You can even find hard negatives for one question from correct answers to other questions in batch - do so in-graph for maximum efficiency. See [1.] for more details.\n"
